## 1. Introduction

* People in the city are living far away from natural at present. The city, fulfilled with concrete and steels, isolates the communication between man and nature. In order to ameliorate this situation, we are going to create a domestic micro biosystem that provide a chance for people to get in touch with the nature at home. The smart micro-biosystem called “Smart Aquarium” that can detect and feedback upon the environmental changes with four types of sensors. It contains water and soil environment which is supposed to react individually to the environment changes through a programmed control center(Figure 1-1).
